# Xanthia

Xanthia is a notification system for MacOS that uses Ubersicht.  By default it is styled to match MacOS' default appearance.  If you have `Pecan` installed then it will pull style from that instead.

Here is without `Pecan`:

## Instructions

Xanthia requires [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).  Once Übersicht is installed, you can clone this repository to where your Übersicht bars are placed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/Xanthia.git $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Xanthia
```

Xanthia includes a script to make notifications appear.  First you will need to create a file for it to use though.

```
touch /tmp/notify/
```

I suggest placing `notify-send` in your $PATH so that you don't have to type out it's full location:

```
ln -s "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/pecan-style" "/usr/local/bin"
```

Now you can use the included `notify-send` to create notifications, like so:

```
notify-send "New message"
```

So, for example, you can enter this into `Weechat` for notifications:

```
/set trigger.trigger.beep.command /exec -norc notify-send "${tg_tag_nick}: ${tg_message_nocolor}"
```

The other use-case scenarios are up to you.  Another common use is displaying what song you are listening to in `ncmpcpp`.

The included file `notify-send` also functions with `terminal-notifier` if you choose to use the built-in MacOS notification interface rather than Übersicht.  In which case you would install `terminal-notifier` via Homebrew like so:

```
brew install terminal-notifier
```

#### Wal

Xanthia can pull a color palette generated by Wal using Sassc.  I have included a script, `wal-set`, that will perform this.
 
To install Sassc:

```
brew install sassc
```
  
And then you must change the username at the top of `scss/style.scss` to that of your own:

```
sed -i -e "s/zzzeyez/$USER/g" "~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/Xanthia/scss/style.scss"
```
  
Now you can run the script to use Wal's palettes:

```
bash ~/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Xanthia/wal-set
```
